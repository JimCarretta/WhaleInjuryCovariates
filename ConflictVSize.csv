"A Navy Amphibious Assault Ship ""Iwo Jima"" reported a whale strike @ 1046. A report was received from a recreational fishing vessel via the Virginia Marine Science Museum at approx 1200 the same day of an injured whale (probable humpback). The whale was moving slowly but steadily toward the ESE. It appeared to have a fresh wound to the fluke with a large portion missing and bleeding. On 11/24 a Code 3 Right whale washed ashore at Ocean Sands, NC with portions of fluke missing.  Necropsied on 11/25/04.  This is a female RW with a near term fetus. Though there are no photos from the 11/17 sightings, drift models and expert opinion support that this carcass is the struck animal. 844 ft @ unk speed (cruising = 22 kts)  **Proximate COD = sharp vessel trauma, Ultimate COD = hemorrhage, hypovolemic shock - 03/04/19 agh","VSzLarge","VSpdFast"

"6","Event added 2014. Dependent Calf observed with fresh wound on flank, surrounded by blue paint indicating VS. Paint wore off by that afternoon. Injury is low on flank, therefore typically below waterline. Does not appear deep. Sighted earlier that day and the day prior but that area not visible. Resights indicate healing.","VSzUnk","VSpdUnk"
"7","37ft, 2 yr old, female. Necropsy team leader: Moore. Skull and right mandible badly broken with associated hemorrhaging - consistent with blunt force trauma. Outside of carcass looked fresh but ribs and vertebra floating loose on inside from intense internal heat. Missing hyoids.

Necropsy by SCDNR & NOS Charleston revealed healed scars consistent with entanglement and rib fractures and muscle hemorrhaging consistent with blunt force trauma consistent with ship collisions.","VSzUnk","VSpdUnk"
"16","Rep by Beachgoer. Virginia Aquarium performed a necropsy on 3/18/06.  Blunt trauma to the head crushing the cranium and fracturing the left mandible.  Left flipper almost completely severed, laceration to right flipper, mouth, and ventral surface; Determination if the injuries were pre or post mortem is pending on histology sample analysis.  Histology samples were sent to David Rotstein, University of Tennessee.

Last sighted alive on 6/21/07. It was found to have a large bruised area from the ventral side of the head of its right humerus and upper chest, down to its upper belly, consistent with blunt force trauma from a vessel strike.

"385","A young humpback whale, approximately 25 feet long, was entangled in the ground line of a lobster trawl. Appeared to be anchored and was unable to move. There were approximately 12 body wraps on the whale. CWRT, DFO and GMWSRS responded. A search was conducted in the area, however, the whale was not spotted. The whale was re-sighted late in the afternoon by the Grand Manan ferry. Unfortunately, weather conditions and diminishing daylight prevented a response. The following day, November 14, while hauling his gear, a fisherman found the entangled humpback. After an initial active response to the approaching fishing vessel, the whale seemed too exhausted to move much. A GMWSRS member on board the fishing vessel was able to remove approximately 12 body wraps from the whale. Following a visual inspection, it appeared that the entangling gear had been removed successfully. Visible injuries were limited to numerous abrasions, one of which was deep enough to cut through the skin, and a possible injured left pectoral fin. Although it was observed to move freely, the left pectoral fin was generally kept in an abnormal position, being tucked up against the body. Following the disentanglement, the whale swam away quite slowly.",NA,NA

"908","UME. Anchored w/ extensive constricting wraps with associated hemorrhaging. Necropsied on 19Sep2017. Only tag on gear was from 1988, but new segments of rope spliced in, so unlikely to be old ghost gear. Proximate COD = acute entanglement, Ultimate COD = asphyxiation/drowning",NA,NA
"909","UME.  Advanced decomp. Skin & flukes missing. Necropsied on 27Oct2017. Evidence of extensive entanglement involving both flippers, mouth, & both sides of body. Hemorrhaging associated with body and right pectoral injuries. Histopathology results support COD=EN (peracute underwater entrapment). No skin/scavenger damage indicating carcass not at surface long (ie, submerged). Not matched genetically or photographically to any known Cataloged whale. Rare haplotype so could've been an undocumented calf of the year or from recent years.  Proximate COD = likely acute entanglement, Ultimate COD = suspect peracute underwater entrapment.",NA,NA
"910","UME. Not reported until 24Jan2018. Carcass towed in. Necropsied on 28Jan2018. Extensive, severe constricting entanglement. Partial amputation of right pectoral accompanied by severe proliferative bone growth. Multiple loops within oral cavity forming partial barrier to pharynx. Thin blubber layer with significant cyamid coverage. VAQS & FWRI both investigated gear. Proximate COD = chronic entanglement, Ultimate COD = nutritional",NA,NA
"911","Extensive new injuries to head, right lip, peduncle, and leading fluke edges consistent with constricting gear. No gear present. Resights indicate healing. Incl in Pettis Jun 2018 - Jun 2019 ""Monitoring Inj Egs"" as monitor. Removed from list Dec 2019",NA,NA
"912","Free-swimming in extremely poor condition - emaciated with heavy cyamid load. Large portion of right lip missing. Right pectoral appears compromised, though no gear present. Severe injuries to peduncle and leading fluke edges. No resights.",NA,NA
"913","New extensive injuries to peduncle, leading fluke edges, head, & lips consistent with constricting gear. No gear present. Healthy resights.",NA,NA
"914","Line trailing from right mouthline, with at least one pectoral wrap, and trailing 50 ft. Buoy pinned close to flipper. Unable to confirm if wraps were loose or constricting. Resighted gear free in April 2019. Healthy resights.",NA,NA
"915","Line through mouth and trailing both sides. Unable to confirm if flipper wraps present, full configuration unknown. Seen earlier in the day gear free. No resights.",NA,NA
"916","No gear present, but extensive new and healing injuries on rostrum, body, flippers, and flukes consistent with constricting gear. Deep injury to rostrum and right blowhole not functioning properly. Resights indicate healing and functioning blowhole.",NA,NA
"917","Free-swimming with buoy trailing 70ft behind whale. Attachment point(s) unknown. Severe, raw injuries on peduncle & head. Partial disentanglement. Resighted on 30Dec with line exiting left mouth & no trailing gear. Possible rostrum and left pectoral wraps, but unable to confirm. No additional resights.",NA,NA
"918","Multiple rostrum wraps with damaged baleen. No visible trailing line, possibly weighted line/gear. Configuration shifted throughout observation. Whale may have shed gear by end of observation, but unable to confirm.  Documented gear free 31Dec18. Healthy resights",NA,NA
"919","Floating carcass landed & necropsied on 30Aug2018. Limited necropsy due to remote location & no heavy equipment available. Second exam conducted on 05Sep2018. Evidence of constricting entanglement with associated hemorrhaging on right pectoral. No gear present. Thin body condition. Genetic match to individual pending. Likely a 2016/2017 calf. Proximate COD = likely acute entanglement, Ultimate COD = suspect drowning/asphxia",NA,NA
"920","Floating carcass. Limited sampling taken at sea by R/V Bigelow. No gear present, but evidence of constricting wraps across ventral surface and at pectorals. Oral cavity likely involved as well. Acute, severe entanglement event. No necropsy, but MT due to EN most parsimonious. Proximate COD = entanglement, Ultimate COD = undetermined.",NA,NA
"921","Free swimming. Initially with open bridle, changed to full configuration unclear, likely a closed bridle. Resight in April 2019 indicates health stable. No additional resights as of Apr 2020.",NA,NA
"922","No gear present. Evidence of new, constricting entanglement. Healed body wrap and insertion scar. Evidence of health decline - grey, lesions, thin. No resights past 15Jan19  Incl in Pettis Dec 2019 ""Monitoring Inj Egs"" reports as Decline.",NA,NA
"923","No gear present. Evidence of new, healed entanglement injuries to lips, peduncle, and fluke insertion. Resights indicate healing. Incl in Pettis Dec 2019 ""Monitoring Inj Egs"" reports as Monitor.",NA,NA
